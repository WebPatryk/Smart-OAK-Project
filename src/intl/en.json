        "content1": "The foundation’s chief mission is to support the youth at every stage of implementing social, scientific and commercial projects. The NeuroN foundation also sponsors activities and initiatives which support people with brain disorders and improve the quality of their lives. Young people very frequently get depressed when faced with vast amounts of information and possibilities and, hence start suffering from depression. The disorder develops in forms of apathy, anhedonia, inactivity and inability to make a life for oneself. Unfortunately, the world currently lacks in tools which would fight the disease and would help preventing its development. And here comes the Smart Oak platform, thanks to which the youth will have the opportunity of creating projects in cooperation with other individuals. The platform aims at assisting peers in establishing good relations with each other, offering them specialists’ support, equipping them with organizational tools, enabling them to develop passions with the support of the information group and teaching them soft skills which are not easily acquired at school. The Smart Oak team also implements in-house projects on behalf of the foundation and is a role model that shows how ideas and involvement can be turned into real and innovative solutions. After completing their secondary or higher education, teenagers often do not know how to manage their career path and struggle with finding their place in society and on the job market. Thanks to their involvement in social, scientific and commercial projects on our platform, they will have the opportunity to develop their leadership, organizational and managerial skills.",
        "content2": "Moreover, they can develop their passions and other skills which will be of value in their future professional life and not only acquire practical knowledge but also gain the soft skills responsible for effective communication or emotional intelligence. The foundation supports ambitious and creative individuals who are in need of having a space for dialogue and implementation of their ideas around them. The whole platform, including the participation in projects, will be available free of charge for everyone. The support is provided pro bono by our specialists who constitute the foundation. Among them are psychologists and psychiatrists who assist us in taking care of young minds and teenagers’ mental hygiene in peer relations. The youth who lack psychological support at such a crucial moment in their life as completing their education may develop disorders which immensely influence their whole life, not only its professional part but also the private one. Since childhood, we have all been accustomed to the fact that it is our school or college that dictates how we function throughout the day, which has a considerable bearing on our self-decision making, creativity and organizational skills. As a result, after the period of education, a new problem arises due to the absence of classes, meetings, examinations and ability to make a life for oneself. Smart Oak is a space for working, interacting and acting. It’s a program and application for project-oriented communities and a place where you can meet with partners, co-organizers, specialists and other creative individuals who assist in turning ideas into functional projects. The platform offers access to various initiatives, events and courses. It also provides the opportunity to see how the work of project groups progresses. The foundation itself provides new perspectives and helps to change the ways you think about learning and working. It also boosts your creativity and gets you going. And to top it all, projects completed among the most creative and motivated professionals are bound to succeed.",
